# Introduction

## Overview

With greater adoption of digital services over traditional physical delivery methods, there is an increasing need to ensure that they are of optimal quality. In this spirit, the **NaelStudio Design Language System (NDLS)** aims to empower agencies to create fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly digital services with a common set of UI components, patterns, and templates.

Where applicable, NDLS complies with the Digital Service Standards (DSS), which is a set of policies, standards, and guidelines to help agencies implement digital services that meet the goal of delivering digital services that are easy-to-use, seamless, and relevant, as set out in the Digital Government Blueprint.

## What is NDLS?

NDLS is building blocks for creating digital services. It is a collection of open-source, front-end components that you can reuse or customise to build websites quickly while not compromising on specific needs. All components have been checked to ensure they adhere to accessibility standards. NDLS consists of 3 main parts:
